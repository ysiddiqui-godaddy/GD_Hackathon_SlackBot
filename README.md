# GD_Hackathon_SlackBot

Project Management Bot: A Slack bot that integrates with tools like Microsoft Outlook and Jira to help GoDaddy employees manage tasks, deadlines, and team communication effectively. With Jira integration, the bot could be used to create new tasks, update existing ones, assign tasks to specific users, set deadlines, and even monitor progress. For example, a command like "Update task ABC-123 to status 'In Progress'" could automatically update the Jira task. As for Outlook, the bot could schedule meetings, set reminders, or even look up free slots for team members. It could make commands like "Schedule a meeting with John and Mary tomorrow at 2 PM" or "What's my schedule look like tomorrow?" a lot easier.
